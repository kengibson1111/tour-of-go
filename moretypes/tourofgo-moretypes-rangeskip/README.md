# moretypes - range (skip)

This shows how to skip the index if you just want a range value and how to skip the value if you just want the index. For consistency, I slightly changed the code to explicitly show how to skip a value, even though Go allows the index "short assignment" alone. Someone new to Go and new to a repo may not see the full capability of the `range` keyword.
