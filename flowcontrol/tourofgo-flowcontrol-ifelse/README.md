# basics - if (else)

This extends **basics - if (short)**. The variable that is short assigned in an `if` statement is scoped to the `if` block and the `else` block.

I'm not sure how effective the `if` short statement is as a coding practice. I can get the same effect moving the `if` init statement to one line above. The variable is in function scope, but I don't know if that is necessarily a negative thing in the runtime.

If I want to train people who are familiar with C or Java, it is more effective to keep the `if` statement as close as possible to representations in other languages.
