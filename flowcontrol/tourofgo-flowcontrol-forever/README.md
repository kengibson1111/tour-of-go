# flowcontrol - for loop (infinite)

This builds on **basics - while loop**. Omit the condition and you have the infinite for loop. CTRL-C to exit.

This should be avoided if possible. A reason for doing this is if the loop's conditional logic is too complex. Another reason is if there are multiple, unrelated logic blocks that merit a loop exit if the conditions are right. For both of the reasons, code can be refactored to make the for loop straightforward.
