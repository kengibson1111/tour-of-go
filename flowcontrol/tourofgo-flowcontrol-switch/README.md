# flowcontrol - switch

This is a basic switch statement. Go does not require a `break` because the Go switch will only execute the switch block that matches the switch case or the Go switch will execute the default block if no switch cases match.

Two more switch bonuses: The cases do not have to be constants and they do not have to be integers.
