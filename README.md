# tour-of-go ![tour-of-go](/images-repo/icons8-golang-240.png)

This is a companion repo for Go's [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).[^1] Definitely use the code window on the tour. This repo contains mostly code from the tour, and at times I add more code based on ideas from the lessons. Code from the welcome pages is not included.

## Lessons

* if (else) - adding the else to the previous sample.

* EXERCISE (loops) - not the cleanest code, but it did meet the exercise requirements.

* switch - basic switch statement.

* switch (order) - this emphasizes switch statement order and the built-in case break when a statement
  evaluates to true. In Java, you can stack case statements - not so with golang.

* switch (nocond) - you can control the condition statements at the case level instead of the top-level switch.
  Slick way of building long if-then-else chains.

* defer - you can defer code to run just after the function is popped off the call stack. Handy for resource
  cleanup.

* defer (stack) - this shows that deferred code has to play by call stack rules. Makes sense.

* pointers - oh yeah, golang has pointers. This is where I think golang starts to kick ass in the runtime. The
  pointers are not quite like C pointers because there is no arithmetic. But the efficiencies are there, and
  pointer arithmetic can venture into illegal process memory space anyway :). Function call stacks can be really
  tight like in C. This lesson is focusing only on a pointer to a primitive type.

* structs - and the fun continues. objects? Uh, no. And there is a way to define and export a "method" meant
  specifically for a struct, but that's later. Functions, pointers, structs - back to the future. For this lesson
  I would assume that the struct instance is being created on the stack (not heap). Whether or not
  fmt.Println copies the struct instance or just uses a pointer to the struct for the call stack is unknown
  at this point.

* structs (fields) - fields are accessed via dot notation.

* pointers (structs) - this is showing that a pointer to a struct can be used to make changes in the struct
  instance. C makes a field access distinction between a struct and a pointer. golang doesn't do that - dot
  notation all the way. In this sample, it looks like a a struct instance is created on the stack and the
  pointer value is stack address space.

* structs (literals) - a few examples of creating a struct instance using literals. In the pointer case, the
  struct instance is created first and then the pointer is assigned. And I would assume for the Println
  call at runtime, 3 struct instances are being copied from the stack to the function call stack and 1 pointer
  value is being copied from the stack to the function call stack. Doesn't seem like a big deal when
  a struct is so small, but it could be a big deal with more complex structs.

* arrays - simple example creating an array on the stack. arrays have a hard limit - you specify the length
  and the array is only that length. And the length is embedded in the type, so [4]int and [5]int are actually
  different types. Arrays are values, not pointers. Thoughts on the golang string implementation: just an
  assumption, but it looks like a string is a pointer to a byte array. Memory for the byte array is not
  initialized until the string is initialized with a value. Then when a string is initialized (like in the
  sample code), byte array memory is allocated and set. So the sample code creates an array of 2 byte array
  pointers on the stack. Then golang allocates memory for the byte arrays on the stack or heap depending on
  the underlying implementation. This seems like a small point, but when you assign and reassign string (byte
  array pointer) values this could be expensive for the runtime. golang hides all of the string complexity in
  the language and runtime, but the complexity has to be addressed eventually.

* slices - this shows how effective pointers are since a slice has a pointer to a backing array. Building on comments
  from the previous lesson, I believe the golang implementation of a string is a slice with a pointer to a byte array.
  The sample code creates an array of ints using literals. Then the slice to the int array is created. The slice
  has the pointer. I would think if a function needs an array as a parameter, you want to use a slice for that because
  that is the best optimization of the function call stack.

* slices (of slice) - and since a slice has a pointer to a backing array, the array type can be anything including a
  slice which, again, has a backing array pointer. Similar to pointer of pointers in C. There is a lot going on in the
  sample even though much is hidden in the language. Each literal string is a slice to a byte array. So the memory for
  the byte array slices (strings) have to be created first. Then each string array is created followed by a slice
  for each string array. 9 byte arrays, 9 slices to byte arrays (strings), 3 string arrays, 3 slices to string
  arrays. So far. Then the array of string slices is created followed by the slice for that array. And for
  the underlying slice implementation, still not sure if the memory is on the stack or heap based on the sample
  code.

* slices (range) - when a slice subset is specified using [], a new pointer to the same backing array is created. This
  is where golang has made a slice more than just a pointer. Only the specified range is visible in the newly
  created slice because the pointer, capacity, and length are unique to the newly created slice.

* slices (make) - the introduction of make() which could be allocating on the stack or heap. The int
  array for a is created and the slice is pointing to the start of the backing array storage. The int array for b is
  created and the slice is pointing to the array storage for b. Two slice pointers, two separate int arrays. Then
  c is a new slice pointing to a subset of b's array storage. The pointer values for b and c are the same, but c
  is only referencing the first two elements. So the length is 2, but the capacity is still 5 because c is pointing
  at the same element as b. Then d is created to start at the 3rd element of whatever c is pointing at (happens
  to be the same that b is pointing at). Also d could have been defined as c[2:] and the result would be the same
  because the array storage for b is only 5 ints. The capacity for d has to be 3 because from the element that d
  is pointing at, there are only 3 elements left. The array length is part of the type and never grows. So
  slices seem to be a way to circumvent array limitations (which exist to provide runtime consistency).

* slices (nil) - zero value for a slice is nil. length and capacity are both 0. I assume the pointer value is also
  0.

* slices (append) - this is another function that hides so much complexity around array storage. This shows how
  length and capacity change as the slice grows. Not sure if there is a function to shrink array storage for
  optimization reasons.

* range - the range keyword can be used for slices and maps. 2 return values - the index and the value.

* range (skip) - shows how to skip the index if you just want a range value and how to skip the value if
  you just want the index.

* EXERCISE (slices) - this was fun to do. After finishing and comparing with other answers across github,
  it isn't the best code, but it works.

* maps - basic example of map use.

* maps (literals) - literals can be used for maps - like structs.

* maps (literals inference) - same as last example, but demonstrating type inference in the literal.

* maps (mutate) - basic CRUD for a map.

* EXERCISE (maps) - maybe not the best, but it was quick :).

* functions (value) - yes, functions are 1st class citizens in golang. And when that happens, the possibilities
  are almost endless. In the sample, compute() has a function parameter. All compute() knows is that the
  function will accept 2 values and compute() will pass 3 and 4 as the values to the function parameter. Now
  you can pass any function that meets the parameter spec and it will do something with the values 3 and 4.
  math.Pow meets the spec, but you can also define your own function that also meets the spec. compute()
  doesn't care.

* functions (closure) - closures are cool. They can reference variables outside of their local function scope.
  So in the sample, adder() is returning a closure that can mutate its own sum variable. Seems like a potential
  implementation for basic map reductions.

* EXERCISE (functions) - not an optimized implementation, but I wanted to do something with slices.

* methods - golang does not have objects, but it does have types. Types can be associated with primitives, structs,
  etc. If you add a type receiver argument in a function definition between the keyword func and the name of the
  function, you have now associated a type to a function. And that is golang's version of a method.

* methods (func) - this is just emphasizing that methods are functions. The sample code is the same as the previous
  lesson without the type receiver argument.

* methods (nonstruct) - this is showing a few things. Types don't necessarily have to be defined for structs. The
  sample code defines a type for a primitive. Why? For this sample, it is a way to overload functionality in a float64.
  Define a type and then define a method for the type. Methods can only be defined for types in the same package, and
  the type cannot be a pointer to another type. So in the sample, there is no way to define a method for a float64, but
  there is a way to define a type to a float64 and then define a method for the custom type.

* methods (pointers) - if you want to modify a type instance, the receiver for the method has to be a pointer to
  the type. So anything that reads from a type instance could have just a value receiver. The only argument
  against that is function call stack efficiency since having a value receiver means the entire type instance VALUE
  will be copied to the call stack for the method. In the sample code, change the pointer receiver to a value receiver and
  see what happens. SIDE NOTE: notice that dot notation is used to access methods with both types of receivers.

* functions (pointers) - just to drive home the concept, methods are functions. So the same arguments apply to passing
  a value of a type instance to prevent updates and a pointer of the type instance to allow updates. In the last
  lesson, you changed the pointer receiver to a value receiver. In this sample, change the *Vertex to Vertex in Scale()
  and you should see a compile error. Fix it and try again. This is one area where methods may have an advantage over
  simple functions.

* methods (pointersind) - emphasizing the indirection flexibility with methods. Functions that have a pointer
  parameter must take a pointer. Methods that have a pointer receiver can take a value or a pointer. golang figures
  it out.

* methods (pointersindrev) - and the indirection flexibility with methods is true in reverse, too. Functions
  that have a value parameter must take a value. Methods that have a value receiver can take a pointer or value.
  golang figures it out.

* methods (receiver) - this verifies a golang "good practice" for receivers. For a given type, receivers for all
  methods should be either value or pointer but not a mix of both. And as mentioned in the lesson "methods (pointers)"
  you do get better function call stack performance using a pointer receiver for methods that only read if the
  type is a large struct.

* interfaces - introduction of an interface type which is the same as in Java - a set of method signatures.

* interfaces (impl) - golang does not require explicit interface declaration like in Java. Just implement the
  method signature and it implicitly implements the interface.

* interfaces (value) - when an interface is declared, it has a nil value and type. It is considered a nil
  interface. The compiler checks to make sure each interface binding is legal. At runtime, the interface
  value and type are filled when the interface is assigned. Then one of the method signatures can be called
  exercising behavior based on the interface's value and type.

* interfaces (nilvalues) - this is where it starts getting interesting. In the previous lesson, suppose t was nil
  when i was assigned. In Java, that would mean a null interface and a potential null pointer exception. In golang,
  the interface is not nil after assignment. It has a nil concrete value and type before assignment and is a nil
  interface. After assignment, the type is not nil and the interface is bound to a matching method with the right
  receiver. The concrete value could be nil, but in golang the method implementation can gracefully check for a nil
  concrete value. Slick.

* interfaces (nil) - you can still get into trouble calling a method signature on an interface that has not been
  assigned yet. It causes a runtime error because a method with the correct receiver has not been bound yet.

* interfaces (empty) - just like in Java, you can have an empty interface. This does not bind any method signatures
  at runtime, but it does allow any type to be associated to an interface.

* interfaces (assert) - types can be asserted and the assertion returns the value and a bool that indicates if the
  assertion worked. Just the value can be returned, but that will cause a runtime error if the interface type
  does not match the assertion. So it is a good practice to return the value and bool from an assertion if
  there is any chance that the interface type does not match the assertion.

* interfaces (switch) - you can use a short assignment to a type assertion in a switch statement.

* stringer - Stringer is an interface from the core package fmt. The String() method signature is like the Java
  toString().

* EXERCISE (stringers) - pretty straightforward.

* errors - another interface from the core package fmt is error. Many golang functions and methods return an
  instance of an error implementation. Then the caller can check if the returned error is nil and react
  appropriately. The sample code shows how to implement the error interface. In run(), MyError is created
  and the pointer is returned which aligns with the pointer receiver of the Error() method defined in the
  error interface. So the runtime knows MyError implements the error interface and binds it. Now MyError's
  Error() method can be called through the error interface by any other function. In this case, Println
  can call it.

* EXERCISE (errors) - implemented based on the instructions. The error type does not have to be a struct. In
  this case, it is a float64. Similar to the previous lesson trying to emphasize golang best practices around
  error generation and handling.

* readers - the io.Reader interface has many implementations offered from golang. In this sample, there was no
  need to build an implementation.

* EXERCISE (readers) - a Reader implementation was the exercise.

* EXERCISE (readersrot13) - another Reader implementation - pretty fun to figure out. Maybe not the most efficient
  code, but a quick implementation.

* images - introduction to the Image interface.

* EXERCISE (images) - even with an empty struct as the type, the method implementations satisfy the exercise
  requirements. If you want to see the resulting image, the code has to be run in the browser version of
  the Tour of Go.

* goroutines - introduction to Go routines. Each routine is a lightweight thread accessing resources potentially
  shared by other routines.

* channels - these are like Java streams. You send and receive values with the operator, <-. You have to use
  make() like with maps and slices. Sends and receives block until the other side is ready, and that makes it very
  useful for routine synchronization without explicit locks. So the sample distributes work among 2 routines.
  When each routine is done, it sends an int on a channel. Both x and y ints are waiting to receive from the
  channel. 2 senders, 2 receivers - remember the blocking. So I start 2 threads to do work and then I wait in the
  caller until both threads are done. AND I have to receive results from both threads. Do the same in Java
  and compare the code :).

* channels (buf) - you can pass in a 2nd argument to make() which specifies a buffer length. When you do this,
  golang uses a buffer with the channel. Sends block until the buffer is full. Receives block if the buffer
  is empty. So try a couple of code mods and see what happens. First, try sending a 3rd int on the channel before
  the first Println(). Back to the original code (without the 3rd int send), try adding a 3rd Println(). The
  advantage of a buffer is to allow heavy traffic even though a receiver might not be ready. Without a buffer,
  the channel blocks on just a single send. With a buffer, sends can pile up in a buffer and receivers can pull
  when they are ready.

* channels (close) - back to the keyword range used in a loop. It works on a channel, but the channel has to
  be closed for the loop to end. Channels don't have to be closed unless a receiver needs to be told. And
  it is a good practice to only have a sender close a channel. Sending on a closed channel causes a runtime
  panic. The sample creates a buffered channel (and the cap() function can be used on a buffered channel).
  A routine is created and then main() waits on the range keyword. When the buffer has 10 ints, the loop
  activates because range can receive. Just before the routine shuts down, it closes the channel. This tells
  range to kick out of the loop. Cool. Again, write the same functionality in Java and compare the code :).

* channels (select) - another way to do the previous lesson without using close(). select waits until a
  channel operation is ready, and if multiple channel operations are ready the channel operation order
  is not guaranteed. Create 2 channels - not buffered. One channel is the main processing channel and the other
  is a "quit" channel. fibonacci() has an endless loop sending ints on the main processing channel
  and receiving ints on the "quit" channel. When one "quit" int is received, fibonacci() ends which also
  ends main(). The Go routine receives 10 ints from the main processing channel and sends one int on the
  "quit" channel.

* channels (selectdef) - just showing that a default can be used in a select. This will activate when all
  channel operations on the select are blocked.

* EXERCISE (concur) - main exercise for the Concurrency section of the tour. Maybe not the best code, but
  it was easy to implement and satisfies requirements.

* mutex - so channel communication is great for synchronizing routine execution. But if you don't need
  execution synchronization and only need data synchronization, golang offers a mutex. The sample
  shows this by starting 1000 routines all interested in the same data.

* EXERCISE (mutex) - last exercise building on previous lesson.

## keys-remote.sh

In a DEV container separate from the container used by VS Code, use [keys-remote.sh](https://github.com/kengibson1111/tour-of-go/blob/master/keys-remote.sh) to validate remote Git connectivity. If results look good, then any `git remote -v` error from VS Code is not related to how Git is interacting with Windows 11 Pro.

## Summary

The tour is pretty fun. Hopefully it will help others get off the ground and start exploring Go.
