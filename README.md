# tour-of-go

golang.org offers a Tour of Go. I took the tour on my laptop. Not the cleanest exercise
code, but I was just trying to satisfy the exercise requirements.

Lessons

* packages - illustrates a factored import and how exported functions from packages have
  to be capitalized. First look at Println. mains run from package main.

* imports - emphasizes factored import. First look at formatted printing.

* exports - shows how you can only access exported functions in a package. The exercise
  starts with an attempt to use math.pi instead of math.Pi.
