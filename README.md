This is a companion repo for Go's [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).[^1] Definitely use the code window on the tour. This repo contains mostly code from the tour, and at times I add more code based on ideas from the lessons. Code from the welcome pages is not included.

## Lessons

* channels (selectdef) - just showing that a default can be used in a select. This will activate when all
  channel operations on the select are blocked.

* EXERCISE (concur) - main exercise for the Concurrency section of the tour. Maybe not the best code, but
  it was easy to implement and satisfies requirements.

* mutex - so channel communication is great for synchronizing routine execution. But if you don't need
  execution synchronization and only need data synchronization, golang offers a mutex. The sample
  shows this by starting 1000 routines all interested in the same data.

* EXERCISE (mutex) - last exercise building on previous lesson.

## keys-remote.sh

In a DEV container separate from the container used by VS Code, use [keys-remote.sh](https://github.com/kengibson1111/tour-of-go/blob/master/keys-remote.sh) to validate remote Git connectivity. If results look good, then any `git remote -v` error from VS Code is not related to how Git is interacting with Windows 11 Pro.

## Summary

The tour is pretty fun. Hopefully it will help others get off the ground and start exploring Go.
