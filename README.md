This is a companion repo for Go's [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).[^1] Definitely use the code window on the tour. This repo contains mostly code from the tour, and at times I add more code based on ideas from the lessons. Code from the welcome pages is not included.

## Lessons

The lessons are divided into the following categories: basics, flowcontrol, moretypes, methods, generics, and concurrency. As you walk through the tour online, look at the URI. The name of a top-level directory in the repo is in the URI. This should help navigate.

The tour is pretty fun. Hopefully it will help others get off the ground and start exploring Go.
